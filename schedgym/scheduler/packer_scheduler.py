    In the paper, they give higher priority to the dot product of requested
    resources with the set of available resources. This means that, since
    the number of resources don't change, the jobs that use more resources
    will be preferred. Every time a new job is scheduled, the prioritization
    changes, since they always schedule one job at a time.
