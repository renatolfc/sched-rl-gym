class Cluster:
    """A cluster as a set of resources.

    Currently, this doesn't make a distinction between machines. So it only
    manages groups of resources.

    Note that although we don't differentiate between machines, we **do** honor
    resources. Therefore, if a given processor is allocated by a job j, we make
    sure not to allocate processor n for any other job until j finishes.

    Due to the above constraint, some checks are more complex (and,
    consequently, slower) than if we disregarded *which* processors and memory
    units were used and only counted the *amount* of resources used.

    This makes our design slightly closer to reality, though.

    The figure below shows the relationship between clusters, ResourcePools,
    and the basic data structure for resource management (`IntervalTree`).

        This is probably the most complex (and most important) function in this

        of events to check whether a given job would fit the system.
